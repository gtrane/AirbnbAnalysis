# AirbnbAnalysis

##Summary
Our analysis of Airbnb data in the Chicago area allowed us to find the best neighborhood in Chicago to begin renting out an Airbnb. We considered variables such as median house price, median airbnb price per night, amount of days it would take to pay off your house (payback period), as well as saftey score for each neighborhood. 
##Technologies used
We used Python for this analysis, specifically we used pandas, plotly, widgets, and matplotlib libraries
